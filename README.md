# Povi
A dictionary for your terminal. This project is identical to my other project, novi. 
But it is faster because it is written in Nim.

# Installation
## First Method
You can download pre-compiled x86 64 binaries from the release page of the 
GitHub mirror of this repository.
## Second Method
Install Nim and Nimble.
```shell
git clone --branch main --depth 1 <REPO URL> povi
cd povi
nimble install
```
